A friend asked me to take some pictures of the farm that had been in their family for generations, before some of the items were sold.

{{% optfigure src="Barn-004.jpg" caption="This barn has stood for over 100 years. Alas, it's unstable and due to be torn down. The wood, however, is being salvaged." %}}

{{% optfigure src="Old car in a shed-002.jpg" caption="This convertible has been sitting idle for too many years." %}}

{{% optfigure src="Old car in a shed-003.jpg" caption="It's been in a shed the whole time, so the paint is quite well preserved. Unfortunately the interior and the convertible top were in much worse shape." %}}

{{% optfigure src="Old car-005.jpg" caption="Another old car, this one slightly newer. Unfortunately it's been exposed to the elements for a long time and the outside was in pretty bad shape." %}}

{{% optfigure src="Old farm implement-001.jpg" caption="Quite a few old farm implements lying around. I have no idea the age of these, but I'm guessing nearly as old as the farm." %}}
