2022 was the first year in a few where I felt like I took a lot of pictures. After a few years of not taking hardly any it felt good to get back to it.

The highlights of this year are:

- Senior portraits that I took of my oldest.
- Homecoming pictures of my daughter and her friends (from two separate homecomings no less) as well as my son and his date. 
- One of the three finalists for American Idol's 2022 season was Leah Marlene, who happens to be from my town. As part of the finale she returned home to do a parade and hometown concert. I was able to get close enough to get some decent pictures of that.
- Senior portraits for a friend's son.

Without further ado, the best of 2022:
