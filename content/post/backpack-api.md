The <a href="http://www.backpackit.com" target="_parent">Backpack</a>
web service has been available for a few short hours, and already
O'Reilly has started using it on their
<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/archives/2005/05/new_way_of_doin.html" target="_parent">Radar
Blog</a>. They've devised a nifty way of tying together content on their
public backpack pages, with the Amazon API in order to produce their
<a href="http://radar.oreilly.com/books/" target="_parent">books</a>
page. This reminds me a lot of shell scripting on a \*nix system, tying
together applications to build something new.

Very cool stuff.
