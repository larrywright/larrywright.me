## Once Upon a Time on the Internet

Once upon a time, I had a blog. This was in the days before social media, mostly. I'd occasionally write some longer things, but often times I'd just share links to things I found interesting. Sometimes I shared pictures. I even did a series of interviews at one point. It was never a terribly popular blog, but that wasn't really the point. It was a creative outlet for me, a chance to work in a different medium - prose instead of code. 

I read other people's blogs as well, which were often the source of the things I found interesting. First with Bloglines, then Google Reader, I followed hundreds of like-minded people and read the things they wrote. It was a simpler time.

## Social Media and the Demise of the Blog

Along came Twitter, which was the first social media network I joined, though it was far from the first. It was new and exciting. I enjoyed following people that were interested in the same sorts of things that I was. Twitter at the time had earned a reputation for being banal - mostly people talking about what they were eating for lunch - but nerd twitter wasn't like that at all. It was a continuous stream of people sharing things they found interesting or posting links to what they'd done. Sometimes it was discussions between people on an interesting topic, discussions that were a lot harder to have in other mediums such as blogs.

Twitter made it trivial to share links and small snippets of daily life. Inevitably, the arrival of new content on my blog slowed. A little at first, but shortly it became a trickle before it stopped altogether. More social media arrived: Facebook made it easy to share things with friends and family, Instagram made sharing photos fun. There was almost no reason to use a blog anymore. I wasn't alone, a lot of the blogs I read at the time are no more. The people aren't gone, they're just posting their thoughts elsewhere.

## And Now Here We Are

Fast forward a few years (ok, it's more than a dozen since this story began). I still use Facebook and Twitter, but noticeably less than I once did. I've come to see social media as the junk food of consumption. It tastes good at the time but leaves you feeling unsatisfied. There are still good things there, but they're increasingly harder to find and you have to wade through a lot of garbage to find them. 

I've also been missing my creative outlet. I had once enjoyed writing longer pieces, explaining how I'd solved a problem, reviewing a book I'd read, and introducing people to something I'd discovered. That wasn't really possible in 140 or even 280 characters, not in any meaningful way. I'd also taken up photography as a hobby, and while Instagram and Facebook are fine for sharing that sort of thing, neither is a great forum for it.

Ultimately, I want a digital place to call home, where I control (and own) the content and how it's presented.

A look around the internet shows I'm not alone. Cal Newport, an author I enjoy who is decidedly anti-social media, has been [making the case](http://calnewport.com/blog/2018/12/07/on-blogs-in-the-social-media-age/) for blogs. Jeremy Keith [is as well](https://adactio.com/journal/14333), and others too numerous to mention. Countless others never lost the habit and didn't succumb to the siren call of communicating to the world exclusively in bite-size content.

## A Phoenix Rises From the Ashes

So I built a new website. The technical details about what it is and how I built it are a story for another post, but now that it's up and running this will be the place where I post most things. Links/photos/longer posts will be here, and then I'll share them on social media. I want to own my own writing, for better or for worse, and there's really no other way to do that other than your own website at your own domain.

The new blog and this very blog post were actually started a couple of years ago, but that's how side projects go. This was never a top-of-mind project, but something I'd tinker with from time to time. Life's a lot busier than it was a dozen years ago, and my attention span isn't what it used to be (whether social media is partially to blame for that is a topic for another day). But no matter, it's done now.

This is definitely a work in progress. I brought over most of the content from the earlier versions of this site, but not all of it. Some of that content has been reviewed and revised to correct typos, formatting issues, and dead links, but that will take a while and so if you spend any time in the archives here you're likely to find all of those things. If you do, feel free to let me know (via [Twitter](https://twitter.com/larrywright), I suppose, or [Github](https://github.com/larrywright/larrywright.me/issues/new) if that's more your thing.

Cheers to the new year, and to new (old) things.
