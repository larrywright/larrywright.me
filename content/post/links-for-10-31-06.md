The latest in a long series of things distracting me from other things
that are likely far more important:

[Sun: Learn about JRuby](http://www.sun.com/2006-1010/jruby/enebo.jsp) -
I look forward to playing with this someday soon.

[Yahoo: Ruby Developer Network](http://developer.yahoo.com/ruby/) -
Yeah, I'm a little late on this one. Included just in case you have
spent the recent months in a cave.

[Free CSS Templates](http://www.free-css-templates.com/home/free_css_xhtml_templates/)
- Very nice stuff here.

[The Shire of Bend, Oregon](http://www.bendshire.com/) - Middle
Earth-ish homes. Very unique, and very cool. Almost makes me want to
leave the midwest for Oregon. Almost.

[Weird Al: White and Nerdy](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-xEzGIuY7kw)

[Jack Slocum: Real-world examples of the Yahoo UI Library](http://www.jackslocum.com/yui/) - This stuff continues to
impress me.

[Javascript tabifier](http://www.barelyfitz.com/projects/tabber/) - Best
HTML/Javascript tabs I've seen yet. Ridiculously easy to use as well.
