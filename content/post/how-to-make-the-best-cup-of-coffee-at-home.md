I am a huge fan of coffee and over the years I have tried a lot of
different means of preparing it. I currently own a french press, a drip
maker, and a stovetop espresso pot. All of these make good coffee, with
each having its own set of pros and cons. Last year, however, I
discovered the best method for brewing coffee:
[Aeropress](http://www.amazon.com/Aerobie-AeroPress-Coffee-Espresso-Maker/dp/B0047BIWSK/).
It makes delicious coffee, takes up almost no space in your kitchen, and
cleanup is easy.

The Aeropress works kind of like an espresso maker, though at a much
lower pressure. The coffee it produces is espresso strength. This means
you can drink it like an espresso or use it to create espresso-based
drinks like Cafe Au Lait or Capuccino. I add hot water to mine to make
an [Americano](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CaffÃ¨_Americano).

Since getting the Aeropress, it's been the only method I've used to brew
coffee. It's replaced the drip machine in our kitchen. It takes up
almost no space, travels well, and produces consistently great coffee.
Perhaps the greatest feature is the one I haven't mentioned yet: price.
It will set you back a little more than \$20, much lower than a decent
home espresso machine or even a drip coffee maker. It's great for
traveling or camping. Any place you can make hot water, you can make
coffee with the Aeropress.

One caveat: you will need a coffee grinder, or a place to buy beans that
will grind them for you. Coffee ground for a drip coffee maker won't
work (which rules out pretty much all pre-ground coffee you would get at
the store). You need grounds that are somewhere between espresso and
drip. You're really going to want a conical burr grinder, similar to
this one: I suspect if you've read this far than you either have one or
are willing to buy one.

In summary: If you enjoy great coffee, you need an
[Aeropress](http://www.amazon.com/Aerobie-AeroPress-Coffee-Espresso-Maker/dp/B0047BIWSK/).
