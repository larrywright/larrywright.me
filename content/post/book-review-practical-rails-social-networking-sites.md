### Summary

[Rails Social Networking
Sites](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590598415?ie=UTF8&tag=approachingno-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=1590598415)
walks you through the process of building a Web 2.0 social networking
site (something like MySpace), called [Rails
Coders](http://railscoders.net/) that includes the features you would
expect in that sort of site:

-   User signup and management (based on restful\_authentication)
-   Content management
-   Blogging (with web services)
-   Markup languages like Textile and Liquid
-   Mashups using Google Maps and Flickr
-   photo management (attachment\_fu and RMagick)
-   Tagging

This book is not, of course, about building social networking sites,
though that does serve as the exercise in the book. It's about going
beyond the basics with Ruby on Rails, and building something useful.

[Rails Social Networking
Sites](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590598415?ie=UTF8&tag=approachingno-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=1590598415)
is targeted at developers who have some experience with developing Rails
applications. That said, you don't need much. If you have read one of
the other books on Rails or developed a couple of play applications,
you'll be fine.

### Pros

There's a lot to like about this book. It's well written, and covers a
broad range of useful topics. Here's the things I really liked:

-   It covers useful topics in the context of a real-world application.
    Most of the Rails books out there (at least the ones I own or have
    looked through) cover the basics of Rails, and maybe a few
    additional plugins. Anyone building a real-world application will
    need to scour the internet for help with the other plugins available
    to do things like handle file uploads, user authentication, and
    the like. While this book doesn't cover everything you could
    possible want to do, it covers a lot.

-   There is a very big emphasis on testing. It's not TDD (see my note
    in the cons below), but in every chapter you will be shown how to
    build something, and then how to test what you built.

-   It's current. The application is built in a RESTful style, and there
    is frequent mention of the changes/deprecations coming in the Rails
    2.0 release.

### Cons

There's really very little wrong with this book. It appears to have been
technical reviewed thoroughly, and as a result I didn't find any glaring
technical errors. That said, there are a few things about the book that
I took some issue with:

-   The book frequently references blog posts as resources. This seems
    like a bad practice to me, as these urls tend to have a
    short lifespan. It's very likely that many of these urls will be
    dead links within a year or so. To be fair, this is a book covering
    a rapidly moving technology, and it's likely to be largely out of
    date in 18-24 months. Therefore, this may not be much of an issue.
    Still, it might be a better idea to link to the book's
    website instead.

-   While the book does give ample coverage to testing (more than most
    books), it would have been nice if the testing was done Test First,
    rather than bolted on after the fact.
    
All in all, these are really minor points.

### Conclusion

Overall, I really liked this book, and I believe it will be very useful
to anyone developing with Ruby on Rails. Whether you're on your first
application or you've been developing for a while, you will find useful
information in [Rails Social Networking
Sites](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590598415?ie=UTF8&tag=approachingno-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=1590598415).
