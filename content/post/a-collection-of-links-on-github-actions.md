[Github Actions](https://github.com/features/actions/) is really intriguing, and I'm excited to get my hands on it. It's not enabled for my account yet, but once it is I'm going to dive in and automate a bunch of things, starting with the publishing of this blog (which I currently do with AWS CodeBuild).

While I wait paitently-ish, I've collected some links to things I've read about it.
