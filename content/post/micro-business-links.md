A couple of micro-venture links from the last couple of days:

[Mark Cuban on Success &
Motivation](http://www.blogmaverick.com/entry/1234000123070608/)

Mark Cuban, whose writing style I really enjoy, posts a collection of
the articles he's written over the last few years on how he got to where
he is today.

[Life Beyond Code - 10 Questions to ask yourself when you are
small](http://blog.lifebeyondcode.com/blog/_archives/2005/11/29/1427997.html)

Rajesh Setty does a reality check for startups.

I found both of these via [microISV](http://www.microisv.com/), which is
a great resource for people interested in that sort of thing.
