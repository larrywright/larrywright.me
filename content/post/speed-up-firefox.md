Firefox has seemed sluggish on my Ubuntu installation, which I
attributed to my aging 1.1Ghz PIII, and rather limited memory (512MB).
In a fit of frustration, I googled for "speed up Firefox" and came up
with some good tweaks to the config that made a huge difference. If you
are a Firefox user, you owe it to yourself to check this out.

[Link 1](http://www.freerepublic.com/focus/f-news/1299854/posts) - This
is a good start, and if you do nothing else, make these changes.

- This is a little more in-depth. It contains the same basic tweaks as
the first article, plus several others. It also has the tweaks grouped
by whether you have a fast/slow computer and a fast/slow connection.

Hope this helps.
