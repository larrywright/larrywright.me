When budgets get tight, it can be difficult to provide adequate training
for your staff. Over the last couple of years, I've found some ways to
provide some training even in the face of a shrinking (or non-existent)
budget.

### Regional conferences

If you still have some budget, but maybe just not as much as you are
accustomed to, look to smaller regional conferences as an alternative to
the larger national ones that are in major cities. If you're fortunate
enough to live in a city where a conference is being held, you might get
out of having to pay for travel at all. This past year, the excellent
[No Fluff Just Stuff](http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/home/main)
conference made a stop in our town, and I was able to send two
developers plus myself to it for a fraction of what it would have cost
to send them away somewhere and pay airfare and hotel on top of the
conference cost. I personally attended the [Windy City
Rails](http://windycityrails.org) conference this year which was a
single day for only \$150. While the smaller conferences may not have
all the speakers you would get at a larger one, I've been really
surprised at the quality of the speakers that these conferences draw.

### Books

My team has done this for the past year or so. I buy a copy of a book
for each person, and we meet once a week to discuss a chapter at a time.
Have people take turns leading the discussion. My experience has been
that these are most productive if you tackle a topic that your team
agrees is currently a pain point, as they can take the information they
learn and apply it to their current project. We've read through [The
Pragmatic
Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/020161622X?ie=UTF8&tag=approachingno-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=020161622X),
[Pragmatic Unit Testingin
Java](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0974514012?ie=UTF8&tag=approachingno-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0974514012),
and are going to move on to [Don't Make Me
Think](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0321344758?ie=UTF8&tag=approachingno-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0321344758)
next.

Hashrocket has actually taken this a step further and [broadcast these
live](http://www.ustream.tv/channel/Hashrocket-Bookclub).

### Videos

It's become commonplace for conferences to record their talks and make
them available online for free. Additionally, a number of larger user
groups do the same. There are a nearly endless number of videos on a
wide variety of topics that are available online. Pick a video (maybe
two if they're short), watch it as a group, and then discuss it
afterwards.

#### Here are a few sources I like:

-   [Peepcode](http://peepcode.com) - these aren't free, but they're
    close
-   [InfoQ](http://www.infoq.com/)
-   [Confreaks](http://confreaks.net/events) - lots of videos from a
    variety of conferences
-   [Windy City Rails](http://windycityrails.org/videos2010/)
-   [San Diego Ruby](http://sdruby.org/podcast) - The San Diego Ruby
    group has a great video podcast that covers a broad variety of
    topics

### Peer to Peer

We've done this even before our training budget shrank. Have people take
turns presenting on a relevant topic that they are passionate about.
This works well on a few levels: those listening get to expand their
knowledge, and those presenting will often develop a deeper
understanding of their topic. If a presentation is used, post it
somewhere so that people who join the company later can benefit.

So what have I missed? What do you do to keep your skills current when
you can't get money for training?
