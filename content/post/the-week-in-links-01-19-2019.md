These are the things that captured my attention in the past week.

### &raquo; [A story of an online stalker takes a bizarre turn down the rabbit hole](https://mashable.com/article/chloe-condon-tee-medlin-twitter-harassment-tech/#johaQ2VcaZqx)

I watched this story unfold on Twitter over a weekend, and it kept getting crazier. You should also read [Chloe's own post on the matter.](https://medium.com/newco/what-its-like-to-be-a-woman-on-the-internet-55f7e6d5044c).

### &raquo; [The curious case of the Raspberry Pi in the network closet](https://blog.haschek.at/2018/the-curious-case-of-the-RasPi-in-our-network.html)

A story of a completely different sort, but no less interesting. With computers being so compact these days, it's surprising this doesn' happen more often.

### &raquo; [AWS For Everyone: New clues emerge about Amazonâ€™s secretive low-code/no-code project](https://www.geekwire.com/2019/aws-everyone-new-clues-emerge-amazons-secretive-low-code-no-code-project/amp/)

If this is true (seems likely), it will be massively successful. As described, it sounds like the spiritual successor to [Yahoo! Pipes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yahoo!_Pipes), which was way ahead of its time.

### &raquo; [How Airbnb is Moving 10x Faster at Scale with GraphQL and Apollo](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/how-airbnb-is-moving-10x-faster-at-scale-with-graphql-and-apollo-aa4ec92d69e2)

I'm starting to experiment with GraphQL. It's early days, but GraphQL seems like the right solution for a lot of problems.

### &raquo; [iOS Shortcut for Importing Photos into Lightroom](https://shawnblanc.net/2019/01/ios-shortcut-for-importing-photos-into-lightroom/)

The iPad Pro is starting to play a bigger role in my photography. When I went to Florida on vacation this summer I didn't take my laptop at all, only my iPad Pro. There are still some awkward bits about working with RAW files on iOS, but overall it's become capable of handling a lot of things. Also, I'm starting to build/acquire a bunch of iOS shortcuts now. It's so easy to build them, and I've already found a number that I'm using daily.

### &raquo; [Signal v Noise exits Medium](https://m.signalvnoise.com/signal-v-noise-exits-medium/)

Their reasoning is similar to [mine]({{< ref "/post/new-year-new-blog.md" >}}). Perhaps it's just selection bias but I see this sentiment echoed all over lately.
