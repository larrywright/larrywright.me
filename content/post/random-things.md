I have a few articles I want to publish, but I'm holding off until I
have this site moved over to [Slicehost](http://www.slicehost.com). In
the meantime, here's a [kottke](http://www.kottke.org) - style list of
random things that have caught my eye lately.

[How to Charm a
Woman](http://dating.personals.yahoo.com/singles/datingtips/3346/how-to-charm-a-woman)

I am(thankfully) long past dating, but just because you've convinced her
to marry you doesn't mean you don't still need to charm her.

[How YouTube
scales](http://kylecordes.com/2007/07/12/youtube-scalability/)

Summary of a [Google Tech
Talk](http://video.google.com/videoplay?docid=-6304964351441328559) on
how [YouTube](http://www.youtube.com) scaled, both pre and post
acquisition. With the massive storage requirements (they have servers
dedicated just to serving thumbnails), this is certainly not a typical
scaling story.

[Catch The Best](http://catchthebest.com/)

[Catch The Best](http://catchthebest.com/) is a new "applicant tracking
and ranking system" from [Ben Curtis](http://www.bencurtis.com), who is
fairly well known in the Rails community. This looks promising. Ben is
also [looking for sample
resumes](http://www.bencurtis.com/archives/2007/07/sourcing-the-best-resumes/)
to test his system out.

[The Brand Called
You](http://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/10/brandyou.html)

10 year old article by [Tom Peters](http://tompeters.com/) on the
importance of developing a personal brand. Still very relevant.
