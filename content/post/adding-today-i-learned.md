In the interest of sharing more things here, I've added a section to the site called ["Today I Learned (TIL)"]({{< ref "/til/" >}})
These are short write-ups of things I learned that don't need a full blog post but I share them here because they might be useful to someone else (or just as likely: useful to me in the future). They are mostly going to be technical in nature (at least they all are so far), but it's possible something non-technical will be included in the future. 

I first learned of this from [Simon Willison](https://til.simonwillison.net) but he was inspired by [Josh Branchaud](https://github.com/jbranchaud/til). 

In addition to the two mentioned above, here are a few others who maintain collections of TIL posts:

* [Hashrocket](https://til.hashrocket.com/)
* [Jake Worth](https://github.com/jwworth/til)
* [Jonas Brømsø](http://jonasbn.github.io/til/)
* [Thoughtbot](https://github.com/thoughtbot/til)
