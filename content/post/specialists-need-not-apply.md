[This job posting](http://nat.org/blog/?p=828) from [Nat
Friedman](http://www.nat.org) got me to thinking, along the lines of my
[previous
post](/posts/2the-two-kinds-of-programmers).
Here's the bit that got my mind working:

> Keep in mind that we're not looking for specialists: we're a small

It was implied in my previous post, but I didn't overtly state it: **The
worst thing that can happen to you as a programmer is to become a
specialist.** There are very few things you can do that will do more to
damage your career potential than to only have expertise in a very
narrow set of skills

Becoming a specialist could take many forms. It could mean being tied to
a specific language, a framework, a part of the application stack, or a
specific tool. I often see it in people who have only done the server
component of web applications - they've never really coded a user
interface. Sometimes it's .NET developers, who know how to develop web
applications, but only using the Microsoft "Drag and Drop" toolset. If
you handed them Notepad and told them to code something, they would
stare at you blankly.

<strong>One of the best things you can do for your career is to be a
generalist.</strong> Develop a broad set of skills in a wide variety of
tools. Become adept at picking up any technology you are handed and
becoming proficient at it quickly. Learn as much about as many things as
you can. This makes you rare, and very valuable.
