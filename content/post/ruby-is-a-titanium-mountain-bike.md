From [Tour de
Babel](http://www.cabochon.com/~stevey/blog-rants/tour-de-babel.html)

<blockquote>
If languages are bicycles, then Awk is a pink kiddie bike with a white
basket and streamers coming off the handlebars, Perl is a beach cruiser
(remember how cool they were? Gosh.) and Ruby is a \$7,500 titanium
mountain bike.

Worth the read.
