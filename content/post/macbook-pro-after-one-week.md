So I've had the MacBook Pro for a full week now. Here's my assessment.

-   I don't at all regret the decision to get the refurbished model. I
    saved \$400 and the unit appears to be flawless. That said, the
    Wireless Mighty Mouse I bought with it was D.O.A.

-   This thing is really, really fast.

-   Apple customer service is awesome. So the Mighty Mouse was dead. I
    called Apple's tech support and explained the situation. The lady I
    spoked with didn't ask any questions, she just immediately shipped a
    new one. No annoying "have you tried changing the batteries" type of
    questions - just an apology for the inconvenience and a new mouse on
    it's way. This is what customer service should be like.

-   Leopard is really nice. Visually it's beautiful, and functionally
    there's a lot to love. This is my first experience with OS X so I
    can't compare it to the previous versions.

-   I like the 3-D Dock. This has been panned by a lot of bloggers, but
    I think it looks really good. That said...

-   I hid the dock after the first day. With Spotlight, I don't really
    need it. Because....

-   Spotlight is really, really fast and makes a very good
    application launcher. Hit Command-Space, and type the first few
    letters of the app you want to launch, e.g. 'ter' to launch
    Terminal, 'adi' to launch Adium, etc. See the image below for an
    example of what I'm talking about

All in all, I'm extremely happy with it.
