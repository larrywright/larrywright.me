Kathy Sierra, who runs the excellent [Creating Passionate Users
blog](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/), is doing
a series of "passion reviews". She's started with
[http://www.37signals.com](37) Signals. Interesting article, but I
suspect if the Signals get any more positive PR, they're heads may
explode.
