The text editor is the programmer's main tool. The best programmers I
know are masters of their chosen editor, whatever that might be. Knowing
how to be productive with your editor can make the difference between a
good developer and a great developer.

So today, I'm asking you to share with us what your favorite text editor
is and why.

My editor of choice is [Emacs](http://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/). It's
the first "real" editor that I ever bothered to learn well. I started
learning it right after reading [The Pragmatic
Programmer](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/020161622X/approachingno-20/002-9666217-3990422?%5Fencoding=UTF8&camp=1789&link%5Fcode=xm2)
for the first time. I have a love/hate relationship with Emacs. It's an
amazingly powerful editor - there's very little that it can't do.
Unfortunately, it's as ugly as they come and a pain to customize. Lisp
is cool in the same sense that Latin is cool. Beautiful language, but
hardly anyone speaks it. I had hoped that when I [made the move to OS
X](http://approachingnormal.com/2007/11/11/i-bought-a-macbook-pro), I
would switch to [TextMate](http://macromates.com/). I tried it, and even
bought the [Peepcode screencast on
Textmate](http://peepcode.com/products/textmate-basics-for-rails). In
the end though, I couldn't give up Emacs. It has too many features that
I rely on that Textmate just doesn't have, like [split buffer
windows](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Image:Emacs-screenshot.png) and
[dired](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dired) mode.

As always, post your answer in the comments below.
