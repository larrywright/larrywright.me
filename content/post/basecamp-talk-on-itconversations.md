Jason Fried's talk from [O'Reilly's Emerging Technology Conference](http://conferences.oreillynet.com/etech/) is up on [IT Converstaions](http://www.itconversations.com/shows/detail471.html) I'm
only about halfway through, but it's great so far. I've not seen Jason
speak in person(Jason & Co, PLEASE schedule another Building of Basecamp
in Chicago!), but I've heard several talks of his online, and they've
all been great. This is no different.
