Probably the worst title I've ever chosen for a post.

Regardless, I've been using [Montastic](http://www.montastic.com) for a
month or so now, and it's great. It's a free website monitoring service
that lets you know by email when it can't reach one of your sites. It's
got a limit of 100 sites (I've got a ways to go before reaching that).
I've only received one false positive since I've started using it.
