# Some Useful COVID-19 Resources

There are a lot of useful resources for keeping track of what’s happening with COVID-19, but there’s also a lot of misinformation. I wanted to put together a collection of the things that I’ve found to be useful. This is mostly for my own benefit, but I thought other people might find it useful as well. If you're aware of something that belongs on the list, tell me about it on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/larrywright) or email me (my Twitter username @ Google's email service). 

## What it is and why it's serious

&raquo; [CDC - COVID-19 Site](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/index.html) The CDC's website has the most up to date information on COVID-19

&raquo; [Coronavirus: Why You Must Act Now](https://medium.com/@tomaspueyo/coronavirus-act-today-or-people-will-die-f4d3d9cd99ca) I think this was the first article I saw that made it clear how serious this was.

&raquo; [Internet Book of Critical Care - COVID-19](https://emcrit.org/ibcc/covid19/) This is a deep dive into the illness itself, and the diagnosis and treatment of it. If you want all of the gory details, this is the place to go.

&raquo; [Khan Academy COVID-19 Data](https://youtu.be/mCa0JXEwDEk) - This is a good explanation of the data that we have about the spread of this disease, and what it means. I really like this.

## Facts and figures, with pretty pictures

There are a handful of sites that are tracking the spread of the disease and helpfully display it in chart, graph, and map form.

&raquo; [Johns Hopkins Coronavirus Resource Center](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) - a great overview of the current state of things. 

&raquo; [Epidemic Data for COVID-19](https://www.wolframcloud.com/obj/examples/COVID19World) Mantained by Wolfram Research, this is based on the data from Johns Hopkins, but presented slightly differently and with more ways to view the data. If you are a Wolfram user, you can create a copy of the notebook and explore the data yourself.

&raquo; [Corona Virus Simulator](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/?itid=hp_hp-top-table-main_virus-simulator520pm%3Ahomepage%2Fstory-ans) an excellent visual to show why social distancing is important.

## Get your facts straight

There are a number of crazy rumors and conspiracy theories floating around, none of which are true. 

#### &raquo; [Social media conspiracies blame coronavirus on 5G internet](https://www.cnn.com/2020/03/12/tech/factcheckers-coronavirus-misinformation/index.html) 

There are a number of crazy theories floating around. This was one of the first, and most persistent. It's also complete nonsense.

#### &raquo; [Social media conspiracies](https://thenextweb.com/socialmedia/2020/02/26/social-media-conspiracies-blame-coronavirus-on-5g-internet/) 

Some of the same information in the previous one, but with some additional detail.

#### &raquo; [COVID-19 wasn't produced in a lab](https://www.studyfinds.org/coronavirus-origins-covid-19-wasnt-produced-in-a-lab-scientists-conclude/) 

This is another persistent conspiracy theory, and also not true. See also: [Coronavirus is not a bioweapon created in a lab, scientists say](https://www.heraldscotland.com/news/18314818.coronavirus-not-bioweapon-created-lab-scientists-say/)
