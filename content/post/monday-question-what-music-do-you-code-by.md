Most people, it seems, listen to music while they work. Whether it's to
aid concentration or drown out their coworkers, I see most people do it.
So today's question is:

<b>What music do you prefer to code/design/whatever by?</b>

I have very diverse musical tastes and listen to just about everything,
but I find that lyrics are distracting when I need to concentrate. So I
prefer Jazz like Miles Davis and John Coltrane, or classical like Yo Yo
Ma when I need to focus.
