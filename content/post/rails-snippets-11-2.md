### [New in Rails: Request Profiler](http://blog.codefront.net/2007/10/26/new-in-rails-a-request-profiler-for-profiling-your-app/)

[Jeremy Kemper](http://bitsweat.net/) recently committed a [request
profiler](http://dev.rubyonrails.org/browser/trunk/actionpack/lib/action_controller/request_profiler.rb)
to Rails. It lets you make a request to a URL repeatedly, and then see
an HTML or text report of where your code is spending it's time. This
looks very handy.

### [Building Tempo With Rails - Part I](http://www.nofluffjuststuff.com/blog/brian_sam-bodden/2007/10/building_tempo_with_rails_part_i.html)

A walkthrough of building an app with Rails, which includes feature
definition, using [Piston](http://piston.rubyforge.org/) to manage
plugins, and Restful Authentication. Nice.
