So I think I'm about to buy a &lt;a
href="http://www.amazon.com/gp/search?ie=UTF8&keywords=Macbook%20Pro&tag=approachingno-20&index=pc-hardware&linkCode=ur2&camp=1789&creative=9325"&gt;Macbook
Pro</a><img src="http://www.assoc-amazon.com/e/ir?t=approachingno-20&amp;l=ur2&amp;o=1" width="1" height="1" border="0" alt="" style="border:none !important; margin:0px !important;" />
- the 17" model specifically. Before I do, I have a couple of questions
that I'm hoping someone can help me answer:

-   Is the High Resolution (1920-by-1200) display worth the extra money
    vs the 1680-by-1050 display?

<!-- -->

-   I'm going to buy a Refurbished model from Apple, due to the
    substantial cost savings. Does anyone know of any reason not to? A
    quick google search doesn't seem to reveal people having issues, but
    I thought I'd ask.

Bonus question:

What are your "must have" apps for OSX?
