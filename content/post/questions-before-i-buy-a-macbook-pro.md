So I think I'm about to buy a Macbook Pro - the 17" model specifically. Before I
do, I have a couple of questions that I'm hoping someone can help me answer:

- Is the High Resolution (1920-by-1200) display worth the extra money
    vs the 1680-by-1050 display?

- I'm going to buy a Refurbished model from Apple, due to the
    substantial cost savings. Does anyone know of any reason not to? A
    quick google search doesn't seem to reveal people having issues, but
    I thought I'd ask.

Bonus question: What are your "must have" apps for OSX?
