[Fake Steve Jobs has been
outed.](http://fakesteve.blogspot.com/2007/08/damn-i-am-so-busted-yo.html)
It's Daniel Lyons, a Senior Editor at Forbes. He was outed by [Brad
Stone of the NY
Times](http://www.nytimes.com/2007/08/06/technology/06steve.html?ex=1344052800&en=df82de5e78cf8dc0&ei=5124&partner=permalink&exprod=permalink)
.

I had always suspected it was a journalist or writer of some sort - the
writing quality was too good to be a random schmo.
