<i>Monday Questions is a recurring series on Approaching Normal. For
more questions like this, please visit [the
archives](http://larrywright.me/blog/categories/questions.</i>)

This is a follow up to last week's question [How do you decide what
technologies to
explore?](http://www.approachingnormal.com/2007/11/12/monday-question-how-do-you-choose-what-technologies-to-explore)\
Today I want to know **What technologies are you exploring?**

I'll go first. Aside from [Ruby](http://www.ruby-lang.org) and
[Rails](http://www.rubyonrails.org), [Erlang](http://www.erlang.org/)
and [CouchDB](http://couchdb.org/) are the things that I'm currently
spending time looking into.
