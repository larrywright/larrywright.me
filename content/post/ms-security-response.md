I'm not a huge fan of MS, but there's a fascinating
[article](http://www.eweek.com/article2/0,1895,1852594,00.asp) at eWeek
on how Microsoft responds to threats (particularly this [last
worm](http://www.microsoft.com/security/incident/zotob.mspx)).\
 It's an interesting insight into how good MS has gotten at responding
to this stuff.
