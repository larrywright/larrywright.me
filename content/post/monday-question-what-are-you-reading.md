I'm going to start posting questions for my readers every Monday. At
least until I run out of questions.

Last week, I posted a [collection of mini book
reviews](http://www.approachingnormal.com/2007/10/27/what-i-ve-been-reading).
I have a bit of an addiction to books, which should be obvious by now.
So today's questions is: **What are you reading?** Doesn't matter
whether it's fiction or non-fiction, technical or biographical. Let us
all know what you're reading (or have read recently).
