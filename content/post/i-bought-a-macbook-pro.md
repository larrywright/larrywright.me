As a follow on to [last week's
post](/post/questions-before-i-buy-a-macbook-pro),
I ended up buying a 17" MacBook Pro this week. I went with a refurbished
model (which saved me \$400), and skipped the high resolution display.
It should be here on Wednesday.

It's my first Mac, and I've wanted one for ages, so I'm excited to get
it.
