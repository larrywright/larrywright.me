A list of random and assorted things I have found lately

#### [New York Times blog on open source technology at the Times](http://open.blogs.nytimes.com/)

> "A blog about open source technology at The New York Times, written by
> and primarily for developers. This includes our own projects, our work
> with open-source technologies at nytimes.com, and other interesting
> topics in the open source and Web 2.0 worlds."

There are a lot of nice posts in there, including one on how they used
EC2 to convert their archives to PDF.

#### [Desert Rails Plugin](http://pivotalrb.rubyforge.org/svn/desert/trunk/README)

<blockquote>
Desert is a component framework for Rails that allows you to seamlessly
define in your plugins: \* Models \* Controllers \* Views \* Helpers \*
Routes \* Migrations \* Plugin Dependencies

</blockquote>
I'm going to check this out for something I'm about to start on.

#### [Five Runs Interviews](http://blog.fiveruns.com/takefive)

[Five Runs](http://www.fiveruns.com) is conducting a series of
5-question interviews. So far they have interviewed [Chad
Fowler](http://www.chadfowler.com), [Michael
Cote](http://www.redmonk.com/cote/) and [Peter
Cooper](http://www.petercooper.co.uk).

#### [Arc is Released](http://paulgraham.com/arc0.html)

Paul Graham has released [Arc](http://www.arclanguage.org), his
long-awaited Lisp dialect.

> Arc is designed above all for exploratory programming: the kind where
> you decide what to write by writing it. A good medium for exploratory
> programming is one that makes programs brief and malleable, so that's
> what we've aimed for. This is a medium for sketching software.
