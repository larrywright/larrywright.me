I’m a perpetually curious person who likes working with smart people to use technology to solve difficult problems.

I have had a 20+ year career in technology, and in that time have had roles that included developer, team lead, manager, architect, and more. Since 2012, I have been focused on both infrastructure automation and cloud technologies, working with Chef, Jenkins, Ruby, Python, Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure and others.  Currently I work for [Accenture](https://accenture.com) as an architect on the [Accenture Cloud Platform](https://www.accenture.com/us-en/cloud-platform-management). I enjoy the challenge of keeping up with the pace of change in technology as it feeds my curious nature and fits well with my talents. I’m currently in an architecture role that allows me to work on the big picture challenges associated with security, scalability, and maintainability, as well as writing code and proving out new technologies and approaches.

Outside of work I'm a husband and father. I have three kids and a dog, and we all live in the small-ish town of [Normal, IL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Normal,_Illinois) tucked in a corn field somewhere between Chicago and St. Louis.
