I've been using [1Password](https://1password.com) for what seems like forever. My whole family uses it so that we can share passwords securely, things like streaming services, wifi, and the like. It works, I trust it, and it's got a ton of functionality. 

I've also been moving everything I can to using multi-factor authentication, and have mostly used Authy for that, which works fine. Somehow I missed that 1Password had added support for this as well, and it can automatically fill it in for you. I've set this up for a couple of sites already and it works great. Much more convenient than using a separate app and having to copy and paste the one-time passwords.

See the [1Password help page on two-factor authentication](https://support.1password.com/one-time-passwords/) for more details.
