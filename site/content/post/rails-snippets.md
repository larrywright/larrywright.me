A collection of Rails links

### [Using Paypal with Rails](http://www.fortytwo.gr/blog/14/Using-Paypal-with-Rails)

This is a nice step-by-step article on integrating
[PayPal](http://www.paypal.com) with your Rails application, using
[ActiveMerchant](http://www.activemerchant.org/).

### [Rails 2.0 Features: Multiple Views](http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2007/10/26/rails-20-features-multiple-views/)

I've only skimmed over the new features in the upcoming 2.0 release of
Rails, but this looks like one of the nicest features. This is a good
explanation of how it works and why it's useful.

### [Mongrel 1.0.3 is out](http://mongrel.rubyforge.org/news.html)

A bugfix release of Mongrel is out. Looks like 1.1 is due soon, and it
looks interesting:

> "Mongrel 1.1 is coming real soon now with JRuby support and a few
> other things."

### [Emacs on Rails](http://emacsonrails.drozdov.net/)

Being a bit of an Emacs junky, I'm not sure how I missed this. Looks
mature, and very functional, and almost TextMate-like. The link has a
nice flash video of Emacs on Rails in action.

### [Free Rails book from Sitepoint](http://www.sitepoint.com/books/rails1/freebook.php)

Sitepoint's book "Build Your Own Ruby on Rails Web Applications" is now
free, at least for the next month. I've only skimmed it, but it looks
like a decent introduction, and the price is certainly right.
