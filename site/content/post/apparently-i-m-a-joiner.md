I typically avoid joining each new social networking thingy that comes
along, but I've joined two lately.

The first was [LinkedIn](http://www.linkedin.com). You can view my
public profile [here](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/2/231/991), feel free
to add me if you're so inclined. My email address associated with me
there is larrywright at gmail dot com.

The second one was [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com), which is a new-ish
site from the folks at [Odeo](http://www.odeo.com) (which, as an aside,
[was recently bought back from the
investors](http://evhead.com/2006/10/birth-of-obvious-corp_25.asp) - way
to go [Ev](http://www.evhead.com!)), that lets you keep up with what
your friends are doing at any given moment. You can send and receive
updates via text messages, the web site, and now by [instant
message](http://twitter.com/blog/2006/10/use-twitter-by-instant-message.html).
Pretty cool. View me [here](http://twitter.com/larrywright), and feel
free to add me as a friend if you're so inclined. Or come to to my [home
page](http://larrywright.me) and look at the left hand side of my page
to see what I'm doing at the moment. As if you care.

On an unrelated note, things have been a little quiet lately, due to
other commitments. Things are quieting down a little now, though. I'll
have some more technical posts up soon(ish).
