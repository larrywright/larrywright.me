I've been a CVS and SVN user for a number of years. Recently I've been
watching all of the buzz around distributed SCMs,
[Git](http://git.or.cz/) in particular. Git has been adopted by a number
of projects lately, [Rubinius](http://rubini.us/) being the one I
noticed most recently. I took down my SVN repository when I moved web
hosts, and haven't put it back up yet. It seems like a good time to
switch to Git (or something similar) if there's a benefit.

So this Monday's Question is: <b>What Source Code Management System do
you prefer, and why?</b>
