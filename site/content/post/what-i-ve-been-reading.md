#### [Never Eat Alone: And Other Secrets to Success, One Relationship at a Time](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385512058?ie=UTF8&tag=approachingno-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0385512058) by Keith Ferrazzi and Tahl Raz

![](>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/P/0385512058.01._LZZZZZZZ_.jpg):http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385512058?ie=UTF8&tag=approachingno-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0385512058

Geeks are, generally speaking, much better with technology than people -
I'm no different. But the fact is your ability to build and maintain
relationships with other people will take you farther in life than any
technical skill you can acquire. For a lot of people, myself included,
these are just not skills that come naturally. Fortunately for us, this
book was written. [Never Eat
Alone](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385512058?ie=UTF8&tag=approachingno-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0385512058)
does a very good job of explaining the hows and whys of developing and
maintaining relationships over the long term. The book is a quick read,
but explains very well some important concepts of "networking" (I term I
don't care much for, but that's neither here nor there). Mr. Ferrazzi
discusses *why* it's important to build a network of associates, and
then immediately delves into the the *how*. He also explains how to
leverage your network when you need to, like looking for that new job,
or when you need the help of a friend of a friend of a friend to close a
big deal. This book is written in a casual style, and is peppered with
real-world examples of what works and what doesn't. If developing and
maintaining relationships with people is not something that comes
naturally to you, then you need to read [Never Eat
Alone](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0385512058?ie=UTF8&tag=approachingno-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0385512058)

#### [Developing The Leader Within You](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785281126?ie=UTF8&tag=approachingno-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0785281126) by John C. Maxwell

![](>http://ecx.images-amazon.com/images/P/0785266666.01._LZZZZZZZ_.jpg):http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785281126?ie=UTF8&tag=approachingno-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0785281126

John Maxwell is one of the best authors on the topic of leadership.
[Developing The Leader Within
You](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785281126?ie=UTF8&tag=approachingno-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0785281126)
is easily the best book I've read on leadership. Mr. Maxwell covers how
to develop influence with people, creating positive change, problem
solving, and developing people - among other things. If you were to only
read one book on the subject of leadership, this is the one I would
recommend. [Developing The Leader Within
You](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0785281126?ie=UTF8&tag=approachingno-20&linkCode=as2&camp=1789&creative=9325&creativeASIN=0785281126)
covers the fundamentals of leadership, does it well, and does it in an
easy to read manner. If you are (or aspire to be) a leader, you need to
read this book.

#### [Founders at Work: Stories of Startups' Early Days by Jessica Livingston](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597141/104-3429296-6459107?ie=UTF8&tag=approachingno-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=1590597141)

![](>http://images.amazon.com/images/P/1590597141.01._LZZZZZZZ_.jpg):http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597141/104-3429296-6459107?ie=UTF8&tag=approachingno-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=1590597141

This book is, very simply, a collection of interviews with the founders
of successfull internet companies, such as
[del.icio.us](http://del.icio.us), [37Signals](http://37signals.com),
[Craigslist](http://www.craigslist.com), [Flickr](http://flickr.com),
and more. As such, it's easy to read this book in small chunks - most
interviews are only 3-4 pages long. It was written by [Sarah
Livingston](http://www.foundersatwork.com/author.html), who is one of
the founding partners at [Y-Combinator](http://ycombinator.com/), best
known as "that VC firm Paul Graham runs" (Paul is one of the interviews
in this book, naturally).

I really enjoyed reading this book. It gives a rarely-seen perspective
on what it's like in the early days of a startup. If you're interested
in starting a startup of your own (or even joining one), [buy this
book](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597141/104-3429296-6459107?ie=UTF8&tag=approachingno-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=1590597141)
- it's always better to learn from other people's mistakes.
