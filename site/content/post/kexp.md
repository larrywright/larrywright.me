[KEXP](http://www.kexp.org) is an amazing radio station out of Seattle,
that simulcasts online. They don't play much in the way of mainstream
stuff, but if your tastes run more towards the eclectic/alternative,
you'll enjoy it. They also have an impressive collection of [live
performances](http://www.kexp.org/aspnet_client/live.asp), and now even
have a [podcast](http://www.kexp.org/podcasting.asp) that highlights
artists you may not have heard of.

Check it out, you won't regret it.
