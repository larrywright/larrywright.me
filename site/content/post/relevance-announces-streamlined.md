**Update:** I somehow managed to misspell Relevance's name. Fixed.

I'm missing RailsConf this year (I have no excuse, I live two hours
away). I'm living vicariously through the other attendees though,
keeping an eye on the blog posts.

One announcement that I just caught was that
[Relevance](http://www.relevancellc.com/) has announced
[Streamlined](http://streamlined.relevancellc.com/), which is a
framework on top of the Rails framework. Some of the interesting
features include (pulled from Justing Gehtland's
[post](http://streamlined.relevancellc.com/articles/2006/06/23/current-features-in-streamlined)):

-   Generator for churning out the initial views and configuration
-   A declarative DSL for managing views, including relationship
    management, field selection, etc.
-   Full Ajax-enabled management views with sorting, paging and live
    search (with configurable field-inclusion)
-   An extensible component system for representing relationships at
    runtime \* REST-ful web service layer around all models
-   Auto user-management and inclusion of declarative role-based
    authorization

It looks like this gives you a really good jumpstart on building data
driven applications (as if Rails wasn't enough of a jumpstart). The
management views in particular sound nice
([Django](http://www.djangoproject.com) has this already, really the
only thing Django has over Rails as far as I can tell).

They're planning on realeasing this at OSCON in July. I'm looking
forward to it.
