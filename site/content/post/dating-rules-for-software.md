Over at the [Creating Passionate
Users](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/) blog
(which has more useful information on it than any other blog I can think
of), there's an excellent post called [If your software was on a
date](http://headrush.typepad.com/creating_passionate_users/2005/11/if_your_softwar.html)
which lays some ground rules for your applications:

<blockquote>
How would your software (or product, service, book, cause, etc.) behave
on a date? Perhaps the best model for software developers is the singles
scene, so let's see how this time-tested dating advice for men might be
applied to software: </blockquote>

The article goes on to give some excellent advice, including **"Be
polite, be helpful"**, and **"Be forgiving"**.

It's an excellent article overall, but I couldn't help but think there
was one thing missing: **"Be easy to get to know"**. Offer a free trial.
Show me a flash or Quicktime demo of what you can do (screenshots are a
copout - how many people started using Rails because of the 15 minute
video? I did.), and offer a forum for sharing information with other
users, and with the software's developers.
[37Signals](http://www.37signals.com) gets this last point very well,
their product blogs are very useful.
