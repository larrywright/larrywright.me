I'm a big fan of
<a href="http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php">GTD</a>. A lot of
people ramble on about "so-and-so changed my life", but in this case
it's true. I had never been organized a day in my life until I
discovered <a href="http://www.davidco.com/blogs/david/">David Allen</a>
and his system. I'm not saying I'm some sort of uber-organized person,
but I'm 1000% better than I was.

There is a big community that has built up around GTD that spends a lot
of time swapping tips on how best to implement the system. One of the
problems with this is that it is incredibly easy to get caught up in
tweaking your system, rather than
<a href="http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php">Getting Things
Done</a>. I have caught myself doing this more than once, downloading
software and templates, in an effort to add that one thing that's going
to make it even better. What this really is, is a very deceiving form of
procrastination. You seem really busy, but aren't actually accomplishing
anything.

<a href="http://www.43folders.com">43 Folders</a> has a great
<a href="http://www.43folders.com/2005/05/fractal_impleme.html">post</a>
on this type of tinkering. It's hard to avoid, especially for us geeks,
who always want to find the perfect piece of software (or often, write
it ourselves).

I'm learning to recognize when I'm starting to fall into this trap, but
it isn't easy.
