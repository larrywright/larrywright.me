### [Holy Shmoly, Ruby 1.9 smokes Python away](http://antoniocangiano.com/2007/11/28/holy-shmoly-ruby-19-smokes-python-away/)

Initial performance numbers would seem to indicate that Ruby 1.9 (due by
Christmas) will be lots faster.

### [Quoted-Printable: My .irbrc](http://quotedprintable.com/2007/9/13/my-irbrc)

If you spend a lot of time in IRB (most of us probably do), it's worth
taking the time to learn how to customize it. This is a good start.

### [Faker](http://faker.rubyforge.org/rdoc/)

Nice clean library to generate fake data. The home page says it's a port
of Perl's Data::Faker library, which I'd never even heard of.
