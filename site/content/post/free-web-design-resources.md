It's a poorly kept secret that I couldn't design my way out of a box
(take note of the generic template used on this site). Therefore, when I
need to put together a web page I often turn to free html/css templates
as a starting point (or if nothing else, a starting point). Here's a few
of the sites I've discovered with decent html/css templates:

-   [Open Source Web Design](http://www.oswd.org/) - One of the oldest
    sites, and one of the best.

<!-- -->

-   [Open Web Design](http://www.openwebdesign.org/) - Somewhat of a
    mixed bag, but there is good work here - particularly if you check
    out the 'Popular' section.

<!-- -->

-   [Free Layouts](http://www.freelayouts.com) - Not as good as the
    first two, but some good designs.

<!-- -->

-   [Open Source Templates](http://opensourcetemplates.org) - These
    are impressive.

<!-- -->

-   [Free CSS Templates](http://www.free-css-templates.com/) - These are
    also consistently very good.

I've also got a couple of sites I use for help picking color schemes:

-   [Color Combos](http://www.colorcombos.com)

<!-- -->

-   [CSS Color Chart](http://www.somacon.com/p142.php)

<!-- -->

-   [Color Palette Generator](http://www.degraeve.com/color-palette/)

<!-- -->

-   [Color Schemer](http://www.colorschemer.com/online.html)

I would be interested in knowing where other people who don't have the
benefit of working with a designer turn for help and inspiration. Leave
your favorite sites in the comments.
