[Marc Andreesen](http://blog.pmarca.com) has written a very good series
of articles on career planning that is worth a read, regardless of
whether you are just starting college or have been working for decades.
Marc has a lot of good thoughts on how to choose a career, a college,
and a job. He then goes on to explain his ideas around what skills you
need to develop to be succesfull.

The series so far contains three articles:

[The Pmarca Guide to Career Planning, part 1:
Opportunity](http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/10/the-pmarca-gu-1.html)

> "Instead of planning your career, focus on developing skills and
> pursuing opportunities."

That quote pretty much sums up this article.

[The Pmarca Guide to Career Planning, part 2: Skills and
education](http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/10/the-pmarca-guid.html) This one
has some good advice on choosing colleges and majors, but the real
wisdom is in his advice on which skills you need to have, regardless of
your chosen field. I won't spoil it for you (seriously, [go read
it](http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/10/the-pmarca-guid.html)), but Marc
really nails the key skills and why they are important.

[The Pmarca Guide to Career Planning, part 3: Where to go and
why](http://blog.pmarca.com/2007/10/the-pmarca-gu-1.html) The final
article in the series discusses how to choose the place to work, not
only in the sense of which company, but where (domestic vs.
international). Marc discusses the different types of companies you can
work for and why you would want to work there. Marc has a bias towards
small high-tech startups (surprise!), but does discuss other types of
companies, as well as starting your own.

That's all he has written (for now). All in all, there is a lot of good
advice in these articles. Read them yourself and then pass them along.
