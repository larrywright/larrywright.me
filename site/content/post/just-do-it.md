[Steve Pavlina](http://www.stevepavlina.com) has updated one of his
older articles into a new one titled [Do it
Now](http://www.stevepavlina.com/articles/do-it-now.htm), in which he
describes the method he used to graduate college in **three semesters**
with a **3.9 GPA**. From the article:

> In order to accomplish this goal, I determined I'd have to take 30-40
units per semester, when the average student took 12-15 units. It became
immediately obvious that I'd have to manage my time extremely well if I
wanted to pull this off.

That's an understatement. I'm not sure that just anyone could pull this
off, but Steve claims he did (and I really don't have any way of proving
one way or the other).

Regardless, there are some really good time principles in this article.
Definitely worth a read.
