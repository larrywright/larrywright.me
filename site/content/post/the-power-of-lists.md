One of the things that impacted me the most about
[GTD](http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php) is lists. It's such a
ridiculously simple concept, but it's incredibly powerful. I was
reminded of this recently when I saw an article at [Boxes and
Arrows](http://www.boxesandarrows.com/) called [Check It Twice: The B&A
Staff Reveals the Way They Make
Lists](http://www.boxesandarrows.com/view/check_it_twice_the_b_a_staff_reveals_the_way_they_make_lists).
It isn't about [GTD](http://www.davidco.com/what_is_gtd.php) at all
really, but it's useful nonetheless. It includes things like "Holiday
cookies", "Refrigerator lists", and even included a bit about
[Backpack](http://www.backpackit.com), but the one that I found most
interesting was called Mantras:

- Simplify
- Smaller, smaller
- Do only what you love, love everything that you do
- Embrace constraints
- Less
- Honor your mistake as a hidden intention
- Disrupt business as usual

...And so on.

I like that, I think I'm going to add that to my lists.

Back to my original point, one of the first things I started doing when
I implemented GTD, was to start keeping reference lists. I use the
"Memos" section of my Palm T5 to store them. I was first inspired by
[The David's tip](http://www.davidco.com/tips_tools/tip2.html), but I've
gone on to create some of my own.

Here's a sampling:

- Fun Projects - Little programming things I may want to do some day.
- Model numbers - This is a list of model numbers for much of what
    I own. That way when I'm out shopping and I remember that I need to
    buy furnace filters, I don't have to try and remember what size I
    have, it's right there in my list.
- Blog topics - Things I may want to write about here someday. \*
    Music - Various albums, songs, and artists I may want to buy.
- Books - Books I want to read
- Gift ideas - Throughout the year, when my wife mentions something
    she'd like, I jot it down in a list with her name. When it comes
    time to buy gifts, I've got a list to choose from. I have one of
    these lists for everyone I buy gifts for. My kids, parents,
    in-laws, etc.
- Checklists - I keep checklists for certain things I have to do
    regularly, like "Project startup", "New employee", etc.

This is only a few of my lists, I probably have 50 or so.

Do you have any lists like this? Share in the comments, I'm always
looking for new ideas.
