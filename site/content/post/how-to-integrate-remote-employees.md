One of my "must-read" blogs, [Rands in
Repose](http://www.randsinrepose.com/) has a
[post](http://www.randsinrepose.com/archives/2006/01/27/remotely.html)
seeking advice on keeping employees who work from home (or any other
remote location) in the loop.

> I'm ready to learn and that's today's question, "How do you, as a
> remote employee, stay in the loop?" The converse, if you prefer, is,
> "How do you, as a co-worker or manager of a remote employee, keep
> everyone on the same page?"\
>  Work-from-home employees is becoming a bigger and bigger trend, and
> there are a lot of companies that seem to thrive in this environment.
> When it works, it seems to be a win-win for both the employer and
> employee. It does introduce a number of issues, particularly if only
> part of the team is working remotely.

There's some good advice in the comments for the post, including advice
on tools, as well as cultural issues.
