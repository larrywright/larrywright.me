A few links that caught my eye today:

[An introduction to Ruby on Rails for DB2
developers](http://www-128.ibm.com/developerworks/db2/library/techarticle/dm-0606dumbill/)
- Nice article if you're a DB2 user and want to know what the fuss is
about. Written by [Edd Dumbill](http://usefulinc.com/edd).

[Ruby-Gnome2 Website](http://ruby-gnome2.sourceforge.jp/) - Appears to
be a decent GUI toolkit for Ruby. I wish someone would get QT's Ruby
bindings working on Windows. The thing I miss most about Python is
[PyQT](http://www.riverbankcomputing.co.uk/pyqt/).

[Sapphire in Steel: The Little Book of
Ruby](http://www.sapphiresteel.com/The-Little-Book-Of-Ruby) - Nice
introduction to Ruby with plenty of code samples, in PDF form.

[Ruby Cookbook](http://pleac.sourceforge.net/pleac_ruby/index.html) -
The Perl Cookbook, ported to Ruby.

[Ruby Inside](http://www.rubyinside.com/) - A great new blog by [Peter
Cooper](petercooper.co.uk), focused solely on Ruby. The last two items
came from this site. I don't know how he finds all these cool links.

[Configuring Rails Environments - The Cheat
Sheet](http://glu.ttono.us/articles/2006/05/22/configuring-rails-environments-the-cheat-sheet)
- Now you can find out what all of those neat settings in
config/environments/\* are.
