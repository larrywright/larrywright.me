Paul Graham has a new article up called
[Stuff:](http://www.paulgraham.com/stuff.html)

> I first realized the worthlessness of stuff when I lived in Italy for
> a year. All I took with me was one large backpack of stuff. The rest
> of my stuff I left in my landlady's attic back in the US. And you know
> what? All I missed were some of the books. By the end of the year I
> couldn't even remember what else I had stored in that attic.

> And yet when I got back I didn't discard so much as a box of it. Throw
> away a perfectly good rotary telephone? I might need that one day.
