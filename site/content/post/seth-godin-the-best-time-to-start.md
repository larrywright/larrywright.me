I'll try to prevent this from becoming another [Seth
Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com) lovefest, but Seth's article on the
best time to start a business was too good not to write about.

From the article:

-   The best time to start is when you're out of debt.
-   The best time to start is when no one is already working on
    your idea.
-   The best time to start is after you've got all your VC funding

> ...the best time to start was last year. The second best time to start
> is **right now**.
