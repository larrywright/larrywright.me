Via [Martin Fowler](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/JohnVlissides.html), I
learned that [John Vlissides](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?JohnVlissides)
died after a long battle with cancer. John was one of the **Gang of
Four** who wrote the [definitive book on design
patterns](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0201633612/approachingno-20).

His [page](http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki?JohnVlissides) on c2 has been
turned into a sort of memorial wiki page by the people who had met him.
Aside from the book, he has had a significant impact on a number of
people. I do wish I had gotten to meet him.
