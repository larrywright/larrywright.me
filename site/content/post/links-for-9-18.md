A random sampling of the things that I've found interesting lately:

[Airplane Seat
Etiquette](http://www.mikeindustries.com/blog/archive/2006/09/airplane-seat-etiquette)
- If you ask me, reclining your seat on an airplane is a declaration of
war. There are few things in the world that are ruder.

[Mark Fletcher leaves
Bloglines](http://www.wingedpig.com/archives/2006/06/moving_on_230.html)
- He's technically leaving Blogline's owner [Ask](http://www.ask.com),
but that's a minor detail. I was a happy Bloglines user for a long time,
but it started to lag behind the other readers. I'm a happy
[Feedlounge](http://www.feedlounge.com) user now.

[Interactive Capistrano
Shell](http://www.ryandaigle.com/articles/2006/09/11/whats-new-in-edge-rails-an-interactive-capistrano-shell)
- This has some potential for a lot of uses outside of Rails (system
administration in particular).

[Video - Woman Calls 911 Over Wrong Burger King
Order](http://stupid-people-videos.blogspot.com/2006/09/lady-calls-911-over-wrong-burger-king.html)
You really have to hear this to believe it.

[Cheat](http://errtheblog.com/post/23) - Cheat is a command line tool
similar to 'ri', but it prints out a cheat sheet for the command you've
specified. Awesome.
