I stumbled across a great site tonight, chock full of the geekiest
videos I've seen. The main sources seem to be university lectures. Very
good stuff, and in a variety of disciplines such as Computer Science,
Business, Chemistry, and Mathematics.

Check it out: [Video Lectures](http://videolectures.net).
