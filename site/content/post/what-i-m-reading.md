I tend to read a lot. I'm one of those people who has four or five books
in various states of being read at all times. I'm always interested in
what other people are reading, so I thought I'd share the books that I'm
currently reading, or have just finished:

[Practices of an Agile
Developer](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/097451408X/approachingno-20)
- I'm about 1/2 way done with this one. I like it so far, but I've liked
every book from the Pragmatics that I've read. This is a great
introduction to what Agile development looks like from the perspective
of a developer, rather than a manager. Even if you're not doing Agile
development, it's a great book on the foundations of being a great
programmer.

[The Tipping
Point](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0316346624/approachingno-20)
- I swear I'm probably the last person to read this. Great read, and
definitely an interesting concept.

[Pragmatic Version Control Using
Subversion](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0977616657/approachingno-20)
- I use Subversion on a daily basis, but this has helped with some of
the advanced features.

[Developing the Leader Within
You](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0785281126/approachingno-20)
- John Maxwell is my favorite author on leadership. I've read several of
his books, and I've found every one very usefull.

[CSS Mastery: Advanced Web Standards
Solutions](http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/1590596145/approachingno-20)
- CSS isn't my strong suit, so this book has helped quite a bit. It's
not a CSS 101 book, it's for taking your use of CSS to the next level.
