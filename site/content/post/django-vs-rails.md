There's a relatively
<a href="http://www.magpiebrain.com/archives/2005/08/14/rails_and_django">in-depth
comparison</a> of the <a href="http://www.djangoproject.com/">Django
framework</a> to <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com">Rails</a> over at
<a href="http://www.magpiebrain.com">Sam Newman's site</a>. It appears
to be a relatively fair comparison.

It's interesting that both frameworks were extracted from large
development projects in roughly the same time period, although Rails has
been publicly available for longer, and has more mindshare at the moment.

I'm happy with Rails, but I wonder whether I would have bothered with it
if Django had been available when I started looking at Rails. The thing
that kept me away from Rails for a long time was that I didn't know
Ruby. I was (and still am) well-versed in Python. I still prefer the
cleaner syntax of Python over Ruby, although the latter does have some
features that I find compelling.

I wonder about the impact of one aspect of Django though: the fact that
the model generates your databas schema, instead of the developer
generating the model from the schema (which is the Rails model). I
suspect most DBA's would go into convulsions at the very thought of
this. I can certainly see how it would ease moving from database to
database.
