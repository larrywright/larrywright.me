<i>Monday Questions is a recurring series on Approaching Normal. For
more questions like this, please visit [the

[Feedburner](http://www.feedburner.com) tells me that I now have over
100 subscribers to my [RSS
feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/ApproachingNormal). That of course
doesn't include the people who read this via [Planet Ruby on
Rails](http://www.planetrubyonrails.org). In honor of this milestone,
today's question is: **Who are you, and why are you here?**. I'd like
you to introduce yourself, and tell me why you come here.
