### [Troubleshooting Ruby Processes: Leveraging System Tools when the Usual Ruby Tricks Stop Working](http://safari.oreilly.com/9780321544681)

A new book from O'Reilly on troubleshooting Ruby (and Rails) apps. From
the overview:

> This short cut introduces key system diagnostic tools to Ruby
> developers creating and deploying web applications. When programmers
> develop a Ruby application they commonly experience complex problems
> which require some understanding of the underlying operating system to
> be solved. Difficult to diagnose, these problems can make the
> difference between a project's failure or success. This short cut
> demonstrates how to leverage system tools available on Mac OS X,
> Linux, Solaris, BSD or any other Unix flavor. You will learn how to
> leverage the raw power of tools such as lsof, strace or gdb to resolve
> problems that are difficult to diagnose with the standard Ruby
> development tools. You will also find concrete examples that
> illustrate how these tools solve real-life problems in Ruby
> development. This expertise will prove especially relevant during the
> deployment phase of your application. In this way, should your
> production Mongrel cluster freeze and stop serving HTTP requests, it
> will not take you 2 days to figure out why!

### [Sitepoint: Preparing for Rails 2.0](http://www.sitepoint.com/blogs/2007/10/31/preparing-for-rails-20/)

A nice, if a bit short, article on some of the changes that are coming
in Rails 2.0. This is focused on what you will need to change in your
application.

### [Creating a Ruby Weblog in 10 Minutes](http://www.netbeans.org/kb/60/ruby/rapid-ruby-weblog.html)

This is a beginner tutorial, specific to using Netbeans 6.0. I've not
played much with the Rails support in Netbeans, but it looks impressive
so far.
