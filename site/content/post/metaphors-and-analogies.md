From a list of metaphors and analogies used in high school writing:

-   She had a deep, throaty, genuine laugh, like that sound a dog makes
    just before it throws up.
-   Her vocabulary was as bad as, like, whatever.
-   He spoke with the wisdom that can only come from experience, like a
    guy who went blind because he looked at a solar eclipse without one
    of those boxes with a pinhole in it and now goes around the country
    speaking at high schools about the dangers of looking at a solar
    eclipse without one of those boxes with a pinhole in it.
-   The plan was simple, like my brother-in-law Phil. But unlike Phil,
    this plan just might work.
-   Her hair glistened in the rain like a nose hair after a sneeze.
-   The hailstones leaped from the pavement, just like maggots when you
    fry them in hot grease.
