Inspired by [Mike Gunderloy's recent blog
post](http://afreshcup.com/2009/10/11/my-tools-of-the-trade-2009/), I
decided to put together a list of the tools I use, both hardware and
software.

I use a Mac at home and a Windows laptop at work; I plan to cover the
Windows tools in a later post.

### Hardware

-   [MacBook Pro](http://www.apple.com/macbookpro/)\
    My primary computer is a late-2007 17" Macbook Pro with 2gb of RAM
    and a 160gb hard drive. I love this laptop, but I made two mistakes
    when buying it. First, I should have gone with the higher
    resolution display. If you're going to have a 17" laptop, you should
    have as many pixels as you can. Second, I way undersized the
    hard drive. It was larger than the one in the laptop it replaced,
    but since I have the three most adorable kids ever, I take a lot
    more pictures and video than I did previously. This has quickly
    filled up the hard drive, to the point that I'll need to replace it
    with a much larger one next year. To sum up: when buying a laptop,
    get the largest hard drive and the most pixels you can afford,
    unless you need ultra-portability.

-   [24-inch Dell Monitor](http://www.dell.com)\
    Looks nice, and very affordable. Mine was refurbished. The picture
    quality isn't bad, but it's one of their very low-cost displays and
    is of lower quality than the rest of the line (I didn't know this at
    the time). If I was a graphic designer or professional photographer
    I would probably care more. Since this primarily displays a code
    editor, a terminal window, and a web browser, I don't really
    mind much.

<!-- -->

-   [Apple Extended Keyboard
    II](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_Extended_Keyboard)\
    These are the legendary Apple keyboard you've heard about, and the
    hype about them is true. I bought a couple of them gently used from
    EBay and then scrubbed them with a brush and some dish soap to clean
    them up. Paired with a Griffin ADB to USB converter, they work
    very well. I'm a sucker for the old-style keyboard action.

<!-- -->

-   [Mighty Mouse (bluetooth)](http://www.apple.com/mightymouse/)\
    A lot of people hate this mouse, but I don't understand why. It's
    solidly built, confortable, and has that cool little ball on top.
    That said, I'm a keyboard junkie and avoid the mouse when I can.

<!-- -->

-   [Time Capsule](http://www.apple.com/timecapsule/)\
    This serves as both wireless router for the house as well as the
    backup system for both laptops. I don't have an off-site backup at
    the moment, I need to look into that.

<!-- -->

-   [Cambridge Soundworks Speakers](http://cambridgesoundworks.com/)\
    I really wanted the Klipsch computer speakers, but they're more than
    I want to spend. These sound good, and cost me only a little over
    \$100 refurbished.

### Software

-   [Emacs](http://emacsformacosx.com/)\
    I learned programming with an IDE, but I learned to edit text
    with Emacs. I've been using it for 10 years or so now, and it would
    be difficult to switch. Every few years I have some brief dalliance
    with another editor (the last one was Textmate, when I bought my
    first Mac), but I always return to my first love. What emacs lacks
    in style, it more than makes up for in substance. In one window I
    can edit code, run shell commands (or a shell, for that matter),
    edit files on remote servers, and much more. It's endlessly
    scriptable and insanely powerful. The fact that it's cross platform
    helps as well. My emacs configuration, which works the same (with a
    couple of minor exceptions) on all the platforms I use it, is
    located on [Github](http://github.com/larrywright/emacs)

<!-- -->

-   [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/)\
    I really want to like Firefox, but it's just too slow. Safari is
    quick, stable, and includes all the features I want.

<!-- -->

-   [The Hit List](http://www.potionfactory.com/thehitlist/)\
    Even though it seems to be the popular thing to do these days, I'm
    not on a continual quest to find The Ultimate Todo List App. I got
    The Hit List as part of a MacHeist software bundle, and it
    works well. I mean, seriously, what do you really need in a todo
    list application? I can make items, I can check them off. The rest
    is gravy.

<!-- -->

-   [Adium](http://adium.im/)\
    It's not perfect, but I can talk to people on pretty much any IM
    network out there.

<!-- -->

-   [Tweetie](http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac/)\
    I used Twitterific for a couple of years, both on the iPod Touch and
    OS X. Frankly, it was left to rot, with no updates for a very
    long time. When Tweetie for the iPhone came out, I bought it
    immediately and after using it for 10 minutes, concluded that I
    wanted it for the desktop as well. I got my wish, and I've been
    happy ever since.

<!-- -->

-   [NetNewsWire](http://www.newsgator.com/INDIVIDUALS/NETNEWSWIRE/)\
    I do not read as many feeds as I used to. I mean, I subscribe to a
    lot, I just don't read them that often. My thoughts on why are
    [here](http://larrywright.me/blog/articles/209-the-coming-decline-of-rss-and-atom).
    When I do read feeds though, this is the app I do it in. I like that
    I can navigate everything with the keyboard and send things to
    Evernote and Instapaper easily.

<!-- -->

-   [1Password](http://agilewebsolutions.com/products/1Password)\
    I can't remember all the passwords I create, or often even the
    account names (sometimes it's a username, sometimes it's an
    email address...). 1Password remembers them all for me and enters
    them for me automatically as well.

<!-- -->

-   [Evernote](http://www.evernote.com/)\
    I use Evernote to track all the little bits of data I accumulate:
    code snippets, blog posts, how tos, meeting notes, PDFs,
    presentations, etc. I like the fact that it syncs with other
    computers, and it's search works very well. I hate the way it
    captures web pages though, it destroys all the formatting. Yojimbo
    gets this right. It's PDF viewing isn't all that great either

<!-- -->

-   [Skype](http://skype.com/)\
    Skype works great if everyone is on a fast network pipe. It falls
    down spectacularly if anyone is on a slightly flaky network
    connection, like say a cell network connection. I use Skype mostly
    for after hours deployments (group voice call), and video chats with
    the Grandparents.

<!-- -->

-   [iWork](http://www.apple.com/iwork/)\
    I use Keynote for creating the occasional presentation and Pages for
    creating things that require more formatting than a text document.
    Numbers is the coolest application I almost never use.

<!-- -->

-   [Terminal](http://www.apple.com/macosx/what-is-macosx/apps-and-utilities.html#terminal)\
    I always have a terminal window open. Always. Usually more than one.

<!-- -->

-   [Pixelmator](http://www.pixelmator.com/)\
    Photoshop is awesome, but it is both expensive and far more
    complicated than I want. I am not an image editing guru, I really
    just need basic capabilities. Pixelmator provides that - it's
    Photoshop for mere mortals.

### Online

-   [Gmail](http://mail.google.com)\
    It's got an amazing spam filter and supports IMAP and POP out of the
    box (Yahoo still charges for this, for reasons I can't comprehend).
    I use the online client almost exclusively.

<!-- -->

-   [Google Docs](http://docs.google.com)\
    I love being able to create spreadsheets and easily share them with
    my better half. It does basically everything I need a spreadsheet
    app to do, and it does it well.

<!-- -->

-   [Pivotal Tracker](http://pivotaltracker.com)\
    Oh, how I love Pivotal Tracker. It's a simple but powerful project
    management application that lets you keep track of features, bugs,
    and chores. I keep all my side projects in here, under a seperate
    account from the one I use at work. Any application I've built is in
    here as a seperate project (this blog, for example). Any time I
    discover a bug, or think of a feature I want to add, I can throw it
    in here under the appropriate project and it will be waiting for me
    when I have time to work on it. It's nearly perfect.

<!-- -->

-   [Instapaper](http://instapaper.com)\
    I read. A lot. Instapaper lets me capture things that I want to read
    later, and conveniently strips out all of the formatting for me. The
    iPhone application is great as well, I can carry reading material
    with me anywhere.

### Hosting

-   [VPSLink](http://vpslink.com)\
    I've been hosted with these guys for a couple of years. Fast VPS
    servers and great uptime.

So that's what I use to do what I do. If you've done a similar list, add
a comment below with a link. Or if you have a recommendation for
something to replace one of my tools, I'm always looking for cool new
tools.
