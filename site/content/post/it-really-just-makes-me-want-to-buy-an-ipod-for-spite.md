So, how's Microsoft's iPod killer being received? The Sun Times' Andy
Ihnatko [sums it
up](http://www.suntimes.com/technology/ihnatko/147048,CST-FIN-Andy23.article):

> Result: The Zune will be dead and gone within six months. Good
riddance.

Yeah, what he said. I've not seen a positive review of this thing yet.

And the junior marketing flunky who came up with "squirting" as the
metaphor for transferring content wirelessly needs to find another line
of work. It just sounds dirty. Like you could get slapped for saying it
out loud in mixed company.

It's possible that version 2.0 of the Zune may redeem itself (this is a
Microsoft product after all), but it seems unlikely. What seems a lot
more likely is that this will go down in history as a "what were they
thinking" event.

My suspicion is that the people at [Apple](http://www.apple.com) laughed
hard when they first saw this thing. For something that was touted as an
iPod killer, it amounts to little more than a paper cut.
