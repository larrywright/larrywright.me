As I meander through the internet, I often find sites that inspire the
wannabe designer in me. I've started collecting them, so that when it
comes time to develop applications, I have a collection to go to for
inspiration. In the event that I'm working with a designer, it gives me
something to send them and say "I like stuff like this".

Here are a few recent favorites:

* [LukeW Portfolio](http://www.lukew.com/portfolio/web_applications.asp)

* [Invision Vectura](http://www.invisionboard.com/ip.dynamic/products/vectura/index.html)
* [Template Monster](http://www.templatemonster.com/)
* [BrightCorner](http://www.brightcorner.com/clients/sr/partnercenter/)

Where do you find inspiration for your work?
