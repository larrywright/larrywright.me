As the title of my blog implies, I'm a curious person. I like learning,
and I'm addicted to keeping up on the latest news about things I'm
interested in: programming, design, and the like. Sometimes I find it
hard to keep up with it all. About a month ago, I discovered
[Prismatic](http://getprismatic.com), and it's changed how I read the
web by making it easier to find the news that I care about.

Prismatic scans all of the links that come across Twitter (that's a lot
of links), and categorizes them using some fairly sophisticated software
([written in
Clojure](http://blog.getprismatic.com/blog/2012/4/5/software-engineering-at-prismatic.html)),
and then matches those links to you based on who you follow and what you
tweet about. It sifts through all of Twitter to find the stuff that YOU
care about. That's powerful.

Getting started with Prismatic is easy. Sign in and link it to your
Twitter accounts and it will present you with a list of articles that
you will like, based on your Twitter activity. You can also tell
Prismatic what you're interested in, by adding, well, interests. They
seem to have just about everything, so whatever you're looking for is
likely to be there.

Prismatic gives you the stuff you care about presented in a single
"river of news" format - as you get to the end of the page, it loads
more articles for you. They pull out a little it of the article to give
you an idea of what it's about, and show you a sampling of what people
on Twitter are saying about it. Each article that you see has a couple
of controls on it that let you tell Prismatic what you like and dislike,
which will adjust what it shows you based on that feedback. In theory,
at least, it will learn over time what you want to see and show you more
of what you like, and less of what you don't.

I've been using Prismatic for a month now, and I'm completely addicted.
It's a great way to find news about the things you're interested in, has
some great features, and there's certainly more to come (an iOS app is
in the works according to their blog). Try it out and let me know what
you think.
