According to Reuters, our commutes just keep getting longer and longer:

> Dave Givens drives 370 miles to work and back every day and considers his seven-hour commute the best answer to balancing his work with his personal life.

Umm, yeah. This is obviously extreme, but it sounds like ridiculously
long commutes are becoming more common:

> In the most recent U.S. Census Bureau study, 2.8 million people have so-called extreme commutes, topping 90 minutes. ... The average one-way commute grew by 13 percent to 25.5 minutes between 1990 and 2000.

My commute is less than 15 minutes, one way. Most days, I get to come
home for lunch and see my wife and kids. I used to have a 7 minute
commute. I kind of miss that.
