I've maintained a blog since sometime in May of 2005. As with many
blogs, posting regularity varied. Sometimes it was daily, sometimes a
month or two would go by with nothing new at all.

This is something different.

The content on the old site changed over time, just like it's author.
Interests come and go, technologies that were once shiny and new have
lost some of their shine. I stopped writing short posts that were mostly
links to other people's content, and starting writing longer articles. I
did some interviews, and a bunch of book reviews.

Then, as is prone to happen, I got busy. In the time I've been writing
this I've gone from having one child to having three. My job
responsibilities have changed. This site got a bit neglected as a
result.

So a while back I started thinking about the site, and what I wanted it
to really become. And I thought. And then I thought some more. My
thoughts evolved over time, and I've settled on what I'm launching here
today.

I'm a curious person, and always have been. My interests are varied, and
change often.This site is a reflection of those facts. Some of the
content from the old site has been migrated to here, much of it was not
as it was either not relevant or didn't fit well with the new site. The
focus of this new site will be whatever happens to have my interest at
the time: mostly technology, software development, and entrepreneurship,
but extending into other areas as well. I will continue to do interviews
and book reviews, and have several of both to publish in the very near
future.

I hope to write here on a more consistent basis, but they will be longer
articles and as such it's not likely to exceed more than once or twice
per week. I've created a new section just for links to interesting
things, called Curiousities, and there will be content there daily.
