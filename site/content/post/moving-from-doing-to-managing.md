5 years ago, I went from being a "doer" (ie, a programmer), to being a
manager. This was not an easy transition. I suspect some people find
this transition easier than others, but I think most everyone who makes
the leap struggles in some way. If you've recently (or maybe not so
recently) made this move, you may find an
<a href="http://communicationnation.blogspot.com/2005/08/craftsman-to-manager-paradox.html">article</a>
by Dave Gray helpful. It's entitled "The craftsman-to-manager paradox".
Dave defines the paradox as this:

<blockquote>
As you move into management, the very things that made you effective as
a craftsman are now deadly threats to your success as a manager. Your
independence and self-reliance, which was an asset, is now a liability.
</blockquote>

This is 100% correct, and I've seen it happen more than once; both to
myself, and to the others around me who were promoted from the rank and
file.

The article also includes a list he calls <b>Ten Communication
Commandments for Managers</b>.

Number 8 is one of the things I struggled with the most:

<blockquote>
Don’t avoid difficult conversations. As a manager it’s your job to
initiate them when necessary. </blockquote>

I have often put off having those conversations, naively hoping that the
issue would resolve itself. It never did, and putting it off only made
things worse.

The other 9 items are equally valuable to anyone in a leadership
position.

Another point to be made though, which Dave neglects to mention, is that
great doers aren't always great managers. It's two completely different
skillsets. I've more than once seen someone who was a really great
developer/server administrator/router jockey get promoted into a
supervisory position and then fail miserably. This isn't a reflection on
the individual, it's more the fault of the person who promoted them. It
isn't that leadership and management skills can't be learned, it's just
that some people just don't have the aptitude (or often the desire) to
do the job well.
