Seth Godin has a brilliant piece on the advantages of small companies.
It seems to me that the greatest innovation in technology (particularly
software) is being done by micro-companies. These are companies like
<a href="http://www.37signals.com">37 Signals</a>(5 people),
<a href="http://robotcoop.com/">Robot Co-Op</a>(7 people), and
<a href="http://www.delicious-monster.com/">Delicious Monster</a>(7
people).

I think that larger companies tend to be very good at stifling
creativity. There are notable exceptions (Google comes to mind), but by
and large this rule seems to hold. Small companies are more able (and
willing) to take risks, whereas risk-taking is seen as a bad thing in
many companies.

Are there are any other examples of micro-companies anyone can think of?
