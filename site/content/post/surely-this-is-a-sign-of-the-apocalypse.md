Just seen on
[TechCrunch](http://www.techcrunch.com/2006/12/04/britney-owns-yahoo-searches-again/):

> Why are you people searching for Britney Spears!? She is hardly the
> eye candy she once was so I just don't understand how she has topped
> Yahoo's most popular search terms for the fifth time in six years
> but is appears that the flashing, divorcing baby mama has.

> Tonight at 9 p.m. PST, Yahoo will release their most popular search
> terms of 2006. In the top five are Britney, WWE, Shakira, Jessica
> Simpson, and Paris Hilton.

This makes me want to cry.
