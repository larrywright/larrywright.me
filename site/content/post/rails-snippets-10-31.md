### [Obvious Code: Creating a simple news publishing system in Rails 2.0](http://obvcode.blogspot.com/2007/10/creating-simple-news-publishing-system.html)

One of the first tutorials I've seen that focuses on Rails 2.0.

### [Deploy a Ruby on Rails app on EC2 in five minutes](http://ec2onrails.rubyforge.org/)

This would seem to make deploying a Rails app on [Amazon's
EC2](http://www.amazon.com/b/ref=sc_fe_l_2/102-6342260-7987311?ie=UTF8&node=201590011&no=3435361)
very simple:

> EC2 on Rails is an Ubuntu Linux server image for Amazon's EC2
> hosting service that's ready to run a standard Ruby on Rails
> application with little or no customization. It's a Ruby on Rails
> virtual appliance. If you have an EC2 account and a public keypair
> you're five minutes away from deploying your Rails app.
