For Christmas, I got an Arduino. Well, really I got two coffee pots.
Identical ones. So I returned one of them to Amazon, and used the refund
to buy an [Arduino starter
kit](ttps://www.amazon.com/dp/B001N1EOT8?tag=approachingno-20&camp=0&creative=0&linkCode=as4&creativeASIN=B001N1EOT8&adid=0PG2BERBTJQ71KV8SW7).
It's a neat device, with a ton of potential. Here's why.

### Ok, so what is it?

The Arduino is an open, hackable microcontroller, designed to be easy to
program and easy to build things with. Simply put: the ultimate hacker
toy.

For about \$40 (or less, if you want to buy all the parts and build it
yourself), you can have a device that you can program from any computer
with a USB port, and that is capable of interfacing with the outside
world. It doesn't require any special training in electronics, and is
ideal for experimentation. You can add an amazing array of sensors and
add-on boards to allow you to do just about anything you can imagine,
from reading the temperature to getting GPS coordinates.

Did I mention you can [program it in Ruby?](http://rad.rubyforge.org/)

### What can you do with it?

Pretty much anything you want. You can start by making an LED blink -
this is the hardware equivalent to "Hello, world". Beyond that, the
basic board comes with an array of inputs and outputs that you can
connect up to all sorts of things: temperature and light sensors,
motors, GPS modules. You name it, you can build it.

Here's a quick rundown of a few things people have used these for.

-   [Build your own unmanned aircraft (UAV)](http://www.diydrones.com/)
-   [Sleep tracker](http://www.coolcircuit.com/gadgets/2008/07/31/sleep-tracker/)
-   [A physical GMail notifier](http://www.j4mie.org/2008/02/15/how-to-make-a-physical-gmail-notifier/)
-   [Robots!](http://smallab.parsons.edu/blog/?q=node/16)

This is only a fraction of what's out there. An impressive community has
sprung up around these little guys, and there is no shortage of cool
projects documented on the web.

If you want to see the Arduino in action, check out [Greg Borenstein's
presentation from RubyConf](http://rubyconf2008.confreaks.com/ruby-arduino-development.html)
on programming the Arduino with Ruby, in which he demos an Arduino-based
drum machine (literally, a machine that plays a drum with chopstics) as
well as a board that uses windshield washer fluid pumps to mix
[screwdrivers](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Screwdriver_(cocktail)).
It's one of the most entertaining talks I've seen.

### Summary

In summary, if you've ever wanted to play with hardware, the Arduino is
the place to start. It's inexpensive, easy to use, and endlessly
customizable. I've had mine a week and it's been great fun so far.

    This is the kit I bought. It includes everything you need to get
    started - even a USB cable.
