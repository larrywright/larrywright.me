The various shiny objects that caught my eye lately.

[11 Ways of Staying Focused](http://www.davecheong.com/2006/06/21/11-ways-of-staying-focused/)
- Probably my biggest challenge, I need all the help I can get.

[Top 14 Stumbling Blocks for New Businesses](http://www.davecheong.com/2006/06/23/top-14-stumbling-blocks-for-new-businesses/)
- Some of this I've seen elsewhere, but there's soom good points in
here.

[What is a Wiki - And How to Use One for Your Project](http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/network/2006/07/07/what-is-a-wiki.html)
- I know what a wiki is, but this is a good introduction on how to
leverage them for projects.

[The Four-Day Week Challenge](http://www.alistapart.com/articles/fourdayweek) - Cutting
back to a four day work week. It's a great idea, but I don't think my boss is going to go for that :)

[Rails Manual](http://railsmanual.org/) - Just like
http://api.rubyonrails.org, except the interface doesn't completely suck
eggs.

[Rails Tips](http://www.rubyinside.com/railstips/) - The extremely
prolific [Peter Cooper](http://www.petercooper.co.uk) (seriously, does
he sleep?) releases something new, [Rails
Tips](http://www.rubyinside.com/railstips/), which although part of the
[previously
mentioned](http://www.approachingnormal.com/articles/2006/06/24/6-23-ruby-rails-links)
Ruby Inside site, is actually a completely separate site, with a number
of useful tips. Seems similar to his
[Snippets](http://www.bigbold.com/snippets/) site, but limited to Rails
stuff.
