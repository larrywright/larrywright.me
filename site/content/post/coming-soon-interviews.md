Beginning tomorrow, I'm going to be publishing a series of interviews.
I'm going to start with notable people from the Rails community, but
over time I would like to branch out into other areas. The first
interview will be with [Peter Cooper](http://www.petercooper.co.uk),
whose book [Beginning
Ruby](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1590597664?ie=UTF8&tag=approachingno-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=1590597664)
I reviewed
[recently](http://approachingnormal.com/2007/11/27/book-review-beginning-ruby-from-novice-to-professional).

In the coming weeks I will be publishing interviews with [Geoffrey
Grosenbach](http://topfunky.com) and [Robby
Russell](http://robbyonrails.com), with more to follow.

If you have suggestions for other people I should interview, please
leave a comment or send me an email (my email address can be found on my
about page:http://larrywright.me/about).
