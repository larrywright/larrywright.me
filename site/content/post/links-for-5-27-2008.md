I've built up a big backlog of links. Here's the first batch.

### [Unix Command Line Kung-Fu](http://www.scribd.com/full/2933314?access_key=key-2lwqsfr2e5s00wi1ztjf)

33 Pages of command line goodness. I've been rocking the command line
for almost a decade, but there's a ton of stuff here I didn't know.

**Update** : Hal Pomeranz, who created this document, sent me an email
with a link to the PDF version of the document. You can find it
[here.](http://www.deer-run.com/~hal/UnixCommandLineKungFu.pdf) Thanks
Hal!

### [Erlang vs. Scala](http://yarivsblog.com/articles/2008/05/18/erlang-vs-scala/)

I want to experiment with both of these languages.

### [21 Ruby Tips You Should Be Using In Your Own Code](http://www.rubyinside.com/21-ruby-tricks-902.html)

The title is self-descriptive, and as you would expect from Ruby Inside
there are a lot of nice shortcuts here.

### [Community Engine: A Social Networking Plugin for Ruby on Rails](http://missingmethod.brunobornsztein.com/projects/community_engine/)

This has been pretty well publicized, but here it is in case you missed
it. Community Engine allows you to add social networking capabilities
(profiles, photos, blogs, forums, and more) to any application simply by
adding this plugin. Extracted from live websites, so it is real-world
tested.

### [Awaken](http://desktopvibes.com/awaken-review/)

Awaken is a slick little app for OS X that I picked up as part of the
MacHeist bundle. I've used it as a timer for those occassions when I
need to force myself to work on something for "Just 10 minutes", but
here are some other uses.
