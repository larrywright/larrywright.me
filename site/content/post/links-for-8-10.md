-   <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/rake.html">Martin
    Fowler</a> has a great introduction to
    <a href="http://rake.rubyforge.org">Rake</a>. If you're not
    familiar, Rake is similar to
    <a href="http://ant.apache.org">Ant</a>, but instead of build files
    written in XML, they're written in Ruby. If you've ever written a
    complicated Ant script, you know how verbose and complicated they
    can be. Rake is the answer to your prayers.
